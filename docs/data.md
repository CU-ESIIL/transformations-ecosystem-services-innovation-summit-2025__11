# Data Access â€” Transformations & Ecosystem Services Innovation Summit 2025 (Team 11)

Use this page to document the datasets supporting our analyses. Capture where each dataset lives, any access credentials or restrictions, and who maintains the source. Suggested sections:

- **Community-shared datasets** (uploaded to the `Group_11` CyVerse folder)
- **External open data portals** (include direct links and citation language)
- **Derived products** (summaries, indicators, or exports generated during the sprint)

Remember to list licensing details and point readers to persistent identifiers (DOIs, landing pages) whenever possible.
