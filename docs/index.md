# Our product üì£

- Static markdown document of case study + model RAD integration (hosted on OASIS)

- Code repository for markdown document

- Explanation of case study

- Explanation of model

- Integration of RAD framework

- Modeling outcomes

We will conduct a case study on a specific ecosystem to explore how implementation of the RAD management framework affects different ecosystem services (and thus different stakeholders) in various ways. We will use the information gathered through this case study as an input into a model to predict how prioritization of certain ecosystem services may demand different approaches within the RAD framework. Our product will be a static markdown document that describes our case study and the findings of that exploration as well as the development and outcomes of the model. We will include a code repository with the document.

# Our question(s) üì£

1. How and when to decide what the appropriate system is for modeling the RAD approach? (model/case)

a. What types of systems is this being used in?

b. Can we identify management "categories" within each component of RAD?

2. How might decision making change within the RAD framework based on the ecosystem service being provided? (case)

a. Specific to the case study we choose

3. How balanced are the different sectors of the RAD approach? E.g. is the "Direct" approach not frequently used. (case)

a. Should a manager start with RAD, or end with RAD?

4. How does RAD incorporate qualitative data / perspectives / lived experiences of stakeholders in the system? (case)

5. How can the experience of modeling improve the application of RAD? (model)

# Hypotheses / intentions

1. Identify a well documented system with a robust body of research in order to explore modeling the RAD approach.

2. Model a real world system using JOSH, incporporating the RAD framework. 

## List of parameters

- Well documented species interactions

‚Ä¶

- Provide an example of using RAD effectively.

(Intention and hypothesis) Better management decisions are made when starting from RAD. üò¨

# Why this matters (the "upshot") üì£

There is currently little understanding of how to effectively implement the RAD framework within actionable management. We are trying to understand the contexts in which the RAD framework may be more appropriate and provide resources on how to effectively implement that decision-making approach, specifically keeping in mind the potentially differing priorities of different stakeholders. We also aim to explore the utility and limitations of the RAD framework.
