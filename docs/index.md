# Our product üì£
We will conduct a case study on a specific ecosystem to explore how implementation of the RAD management framework affects different ecosystem services (and thus different stakeholders) in various ways. We will use the information gathered through this case study as an input into a model to predict how prioritization of certain ecosystem services may demand different approaches within the RAD framework. Our product will be a static markdown document that describes our case study and the findings of that exploration as well as the development and outcomes of the model. We will include a code repository with the document.

# Our question üì£

What are the predicted ecological outcomes post-disturbance when adopting RAD management actions in sagebrush ecosystems?

# Hypotheses / intentions
In a changing world many environmental transformations will be inevitable or very challenging to avoid, so management approaches should embrace alternative actions other than resisting.  In other words, adopting a RAD framework can enable more flexibility regarding future environmental outcomes in a changing world. Based on this, we will focus on the sagebrush ecosystem with the aim of comparing how plant biomass may change in future warmer climate scenarios when implementing different actions under the RAD framework. The current state of this ecosystem is a dominant sagebrush cover, but because alternative states are possible following disturbance (e.g. conversion to cheatgrass or native grass dominated ecosystems), we are focusing on overall biomass as it represents an important ecosystem service despite change.

**H1: Biomass will not be negatively affected (i.e. decrease) independent of the implemented RAD action.**

**H2: Biomass of specific plant species will change depending on the RAD action. Specifically: the highest biomass of sagebrush, native grass and cheatgrass will occur in the R, D and A treatments, respectively.** 

## List of parameters
![Conceptual Figure](assets/RAD_conceptual_new.png)
*Figure 1: Conceptual diagram of possibilities for applying RAD in a sagebrush ecosystem.*
  
Brainstorming treatments:
R: Herbicide/removal of invasive + reseeding sagebrush
A: Do nothing
D: Mechanical removal of sagebrush

(Intention and hypothesis) Better management decisions are made when starting from RAD. üò¨

# Why this matters (the "upshot") üì£

In a changing world many environmental transformations will be inevitable or very challenging to avoid, so management approaches should embrace alternative actions other than resisting.

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
**(1) Choose a study region**
![Defend the Core - Grow the Core](assets/defend_grow_core.jpg)
*Figure 3: Defend the core, grow the core conceptual figure. This strategy, proposed by the USDA-NRCS, suggests focusing management actions on in-tact core areas and expanding sage into growth areas.

![Sagebrush Conservation Design - Study Area](assets/studyArea_core.png)
*Figure 4: Sagebrush Conservation Design Core-Growth-Other classess for our study area. 'Core' represents in-tact sagebrush habitat, 'Grow' represents slightly degraded habitat where management actions for expanding sage habitat can be focused.*

**(2) Characterize the study region**

### Visuals that tell the story üì£
<!-- EDIT: Swap visuals; prioritize clarity. -->

**We should empower those on the ground to blend approaches across RAD but where modeling can be made available rapidly to offer confidence in those decisions.**

![Model outcomes](assets/outcome_overview.png)

Accepting is acceptable but blended offers the most robust benefits acorss carbon and native establishment.
