# Our product üì£ (Nate)
1. Characterize an example of sagebrush habitat in south-central Utah. We will quantify the cover of imporant vegetation types, characterize treatments, climate variables, and stakeholders.
2. 


We will conduct a case study on a specific ecosystem to explore how implementation of the RAD management framework affects different ecosystem services (and thus different stakeholders) in various ways. We will use the information gathered through this case study as an input into a model to predict how prioritization of certain ecosystem services may demand different approaches within the RAD framework. Our product will be a static markdown document that describes our case study and the findings of that exploration as well as the development and outcomes of the model. We will include a code repository with the document.

# Our question üì£

What are the predicted ecological outcomes post-disturbance when adopting RAD management actions in sagebrush ecosystems?

# Hypotheses / intentions
In a changing world many environmental transformations will be inevitable or very challenging to avoid, so management approaches should embrace alternative actions other than resisting.  In other words, adopting a RAD framework can enable more flexibility regarding future environmental outcomes in a changing world. Based on this, we will focus on the sagebrush ecosystem with the aim of comparing how plant biomass may change in future warmer climate scenarios when implementing different actions under the RAD framework. The current state of this ecosystem is a dominant sagebrush cover, but because alternative states are possible following disturbance (e.g. conversion to cheatgrass or native grass dominated ecosystems), we are focusing on overall biomass as it represents an important ecosystem service despite change.

**H1: Biomass will not be negatively affected (i.e. decrease) independent of the implemented RAD action.**

**H2: Biomass of specific plant species will change depending on the RAD action. Specifically: the highest biomass of sagebrush, native grass and cheatgrass will occur in the R, D and A treatments, respectively.** 

## List of parameters
(Courtney insert conceptual figure)
Brainstorming treatments:
R: Herbicide/removal of invasive + reseeding sagebrush
A: Do nothing
D: Mechanical removal of sagebrush

(Intention and hypothesis) Better management decisions are made when starting from RAD. üò¨

# Why this matters (the "upshot") üì£
